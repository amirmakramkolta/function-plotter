# Function Plotter

it is an app you can use for put you linear equations on a graph.
like this equation: 5*x^3+2*x

## Warning

- In the equation input you should only use 'X' uppercase or lowercase, numbers and this operations sign only "+-*/^".
- You cannot assign Min X to be greater than Max X.
- Same for Min Y and Max Y.
- if you did some of this things the App will not work as you wish. 

## wrong example
- y=X^2a * 12
- Min X = 9, Max X = -5
- Min Y = 12, Max Y = 9

## example as it should be
- x^2*12
- Min X = -2, Max X = 7
- MIn Y = 2, Max Y = 12
